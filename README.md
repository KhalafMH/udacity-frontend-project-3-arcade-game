# Arcade Game (Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Project 3)
My implementation of a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger for the second project of the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree.

## Running the Game
To run the game locally follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository or download it as a zip file and unzip it.
2. Open the `index.html` file located at the root of the repository in your favorite browser.
3. Enjoy playing the game.

The game is also hosted on GitHub Pages at this link:

[https://khalafmh.github.io/udacity-frontend-project-3-arcade-game](https://khalafmh.github.io/udacity-frontend-project-3-arcade-game).

## Playing the Game
You play as the boy and you need to cross the road and reach the water without colliding with an enemy in order to win.
You win when you reach the water.

The character can be moved using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
